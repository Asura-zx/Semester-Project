# Car Game Authentication Program- Semester Project

This repository contains the source code for a fun and simple Authentication program for a Car Game developed as a part of a semester project. The game is implemented in C++ and can be played on the console.

## How to Play

1. Run the game executable, and you will be presented with a menu.
2. Choose whether you are a 'Returning User' or a 'New User'.
3. If you are a 'New User,' you can sign up for the application by providing a unique username and password.
4. If you are a 'Returning User,' you need to enter your username and password for authorization.
5. Once authorized, you will be taken to the game screen.
6. Use the left and right arrow keys to control your car and avoid collisions with other cars on the road.
7. The game will keep track of your score as you successfully avoid collisions.
8. If you crash into another car, the game will end, and your score will be saved to the user database.

## Features

- User Authentication: New users can sign up with unique usernames and passwords, and returning users can log in with their credentials.
- User Database: The game maintains a database of registered users and their respective scores.
- Score Tracking: The game keeps track of your score as you play and updates it with each successful maneuver.
- Instructions: The game provides instructions on how to play and control the car.

## How to Compile and Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the cloned directory.
4. Compile the code using the following command:
   ```
   g++ -o car_game main.cpp
   ```
5. Run the compiled executable:
   ```
   ./car_game
   ```
